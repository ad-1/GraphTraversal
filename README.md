# Graph Traversal

Graph traversal pathfinding algorithms visualised in Python using Tkinter. Algorithms include Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm and A*.

## Breadth First Search

"Breadth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root, and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level." - Wikipedia

## Depth First Search

"Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking." - Wikipedia

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

"Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later." - Wikipedia

## A* Algorithm

"A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory." - Wikipedia
